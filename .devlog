TODOs
-----

 - Update tests to truffle
 - There are 21 tests. [8/21] but two are client tests so... [8/19]
 - Theres a bug in the validateEndowment / computeEndowment function 
   that is causing 6 tests to fail, it needs to be figured out 
 - Alarm Client needs to be updated, maybe re-written in javascript / typescript so that we can compile it for browsers
 - Some clean up needs to happen in the contracts so the passed args are more organized.
 - Events are added to the contract so that the client can retrieve them / watch them to act accordingly.
