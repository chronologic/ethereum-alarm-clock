TODOs
-----

 - Theres a bug in the validateEndowment / computeEndowment function 
   that is causing 6 tests to fail, it needs to be figured out 
 - Some clean up needs to happen in the contracts so the passed args are more organized.
 - Events are added to the contract so that the client can retrieve them / watch them to act accordingly.

0.9.0 (WIP)
-----------

 Added: 
 - Full rewrite of all contracts to modern solidity syntax. [90%][done - but still refining]
 - Integrate Truffle framework. [100%][rewriting tests]
 - Port test suite from Populus to Truffle. [done - but still refining]
 - New API for Schedulers [100%][need further tests]
 - Use Zeppelin SafeMath.sol for consistency instead of custom MathLib.sol (Some function in MathLib.sol retained)
 Removed: 
 - Digger.sol removed due to `EIP 150`_ making it obsolete. [done]
 - All stack depth checking also obsolete due to `EIP150` removed. [done]
