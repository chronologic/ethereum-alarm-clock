Javascript Commandline Tool
----------------------------

The EAC javascript cli is a simple tool to ease the use of the Alarm Clock
smart contracts. Right now, we use it as a tool for development. Here's how:

`node index.js -t` 
    sends a test transaction with an execution window that will begin
    in 10 blocks. Use this command to populate the test contracts with 
    upcoming requests for the client.

`node index.js -c`
    starts the client and logs info to the console. The client will scan
    the contracts for new transactionRequests every 4 seconds and attempt to 
    execute them every 5 seconds.
    (pass the `-m <ms>` option to change the number of milliseconds between scans)

`node index.js -s`
    WIP - provides an interface to schedule a new transaction.
