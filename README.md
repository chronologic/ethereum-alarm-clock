## Running the tests

_Tests are in the process of being ported over to ES6 JavaScript._

Current test suite can be found in the test/ directory. Original Populus tests can be found in the tests/ directory.

To run the test suite make sure you have a testrpc running and truffle v4.0.0 installed.

Run `truffle test` at the root of the directory.
